Does culture effect our ability to listen? A persons culture can effect listening. It is offensive to look directly into the
eyes of a speaker in puerto rico. Its a sign of disrespect and its like staring at the person. Now I also spoke to people 
from the arabic culture. The asian community are silent communicators. They do not comment on a person when they are speaking. Sit on the seat and close their eyes. Thats how they focus. The bhuddist community - the concentration is stressed. Any questions? SIKE
